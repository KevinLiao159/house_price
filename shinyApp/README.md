### Project Objective
This repository holds the information of Course Stats 159 at UC Berkeley, fall 2016 â€“ final project. This project aims to estimate housing price based on 79 variables covering every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa with statistical models. Two main focuses are:
1. Incorporate advanced machine learning techniques and predictive model building to solve real-life industry problems
2. Demonstrate aptitude in research and data analysis by emphasizing computational reproducibility and project collaboration

### Directory Structure 

* `shinyApp_scatterplot`, which creates a shiny App for scatter plot visualization

* `shinyApp_model`, which creates a shiny App for tuning parameters of each model

* `README.md`, which describes details of this directory


The complete file-structure for this directory is as follows:
```
shinyApp/
	README.md
	shinyApp_scatterplot/
	  app.R                   # code that creates shiny app for scatter plots
	shinyApp_model/
	  app.R                   # code that creates shiny app for model analysis
        
```
**ShinyDoc**, which is created by the code in app.R, is based on the simple linear regression between two variables. The ShinyDoc will have a dropdown with a list of 3 options - TV, Radio and newspaper as an input element. The output will be a scatter plot between `Sales` and the input option chosen from the dropdown.
